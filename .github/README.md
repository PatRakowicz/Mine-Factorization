# Mine Factorization | 1.14
###### This is a mod that we wanted to work on, and there is really no plan behind it,just to get something working and is just to waste time,and have something todo. But this is only just going to be a mix of a bunch of ideas that we have on a [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCJYzDsmfHuDb07l-7WXAV2roMl3PmX6tSnRx1Yd1GU).

### Mod Ideas
- Add different types of rings | Will have different types of bosses for each. 
  > The types of rings will all have different configurations, for example...
  - Upgrade ring
  > This will allow the tool you are holding to have a random upgrade on it. TBD, if there is max level on tool.
  - Lucky Ring
  > Ring will have a luck side of things. Most likely will just be luck on a ring. Might have tiers of luck.
