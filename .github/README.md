# Mine Factorization
###### This is a mod that we wanted to work on, and there is really no plan behind it, just to get something working and is just to waste time, and have something todo. But this is only just going to be a mix of a bunch of ideas that we have on a [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCJYzDsmfHuDb07l-7WXAV2roMl3PmX6tSnRx1Yd1GU).

## TODO

### Start
- [ ] Get all JDKs working, and all the required packages to get things moving
    - [X] JDK Installed, base running package.
    - [ ] Basic Mod Up and running
    - [ ] Both Me and brandon are on board with how things work
