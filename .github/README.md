# Mine Factorization
###### This is a mod that we wanted to work on, and there is really no plan behind it, just to get something working and is just to waste time, and have something todo. But this is only just going to be a mix of a bunch of ideas that we have on a [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sCJYzDsmfHuDb07l-7WXAV2roMl3PmX6tSnRx1Yd1GU).

## TODO

### Start
- [ ] Get all JDKs working, and all the required packages to get things moving
    - [X] JDK Installed, base running package.
    - [X] Create Mod .jar with gradle.
    - [ ] Both of us know how things work.

### Start on creating items for the mod, [Doc For Forge](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/structuring/)
- [ ] Creation of multiple items
    - [ ] Spears
